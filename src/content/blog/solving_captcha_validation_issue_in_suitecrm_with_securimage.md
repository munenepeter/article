Ever integrated the [Securimage CAPTCHA](https://github.com/dapphp/securimage) package into SuiteCRM and thought, *"Why does this thing fail every time on the first try?"* Well, I did. And I wasted an afternoon figuring it out, so you don't have to!

## The Problem

Does your CAPTCHA validation fail every single time a user loads the page and submits the form for the first time? And then, like magic, it works when the user refreshes the CAPTCHA image? Yeah, I’ve been there.

### What's Really Happening?

The culprit is how SuiteCRM handles sessions.

By default, Securimage uses sessions to store the CAPTCHA solution. But SuiteCRM only starts the session **after** the user submits the login form. So, when you first load the login page (or after logging out, when the session is destroyed), there’s no session for Securimage to store the CAPTCHA data in. As a result, the CAPTCHA solution is empty on the first load. 

Once the form is submitted, SuiteCRM initializes the session to track validation errors and user authentication. At that point, Securimage is able to store its data, which is why the CAPTCHA works *after* refreshing the image.

If you’re scratching your head thinking, *"Why on earth does this only happen on the first attempt?"*—well, now you know!

## The (Simple) Solution

After wasting more time than I’d like to admit on this, I discovered that the answer lies in **namespaces**. Yep, namespaces! Securimage lets you set namespaces to keep track of CAPTCHA challenges across different instances, even on the same page.

### How We Fix It

Here's how I solved it:

### Step 1: Set a Namespace for CAPTCHA Generation

You can set a custom namespace when generating the CAPTCHA image. This namespace will act like a little identifier for your CAPTCHA challenge, so even if the session isn't initialized yet, it can track the CAPTCHA just fine.

```php
$img = new Securimage();
// set a custom namespace for the CAPTCHA
$img->setNamespace('securimage_captcha_auth');
// other options omitted
```

This namespace, `securimage_captcha_auth`, will be our little secret handshake to ensure everything stays on track.

### Step 2: Use the Same Namespace for CAPTCHA Validation

When you validate the CAPTCHA after the form is submitted, you need to **re-use the same namespace**. This is how Securimage will know which CAPTCHA challenge it's supposed to check against.

```php
require_once 'custom/include/securimage/securimage.php';
$securimage = new Securimage();
// set the same namespace used during CAPTCHA generation
$securimage->setNamespace('securimage_captcha_auth');

if (!isset($_SESSION['user_id']) && $resultPlugin->num_rows > 0) {
    if ($securimage->check($_POST['captcha_code']) === false) {
        header("Location: index.php?action=Login&module=Users&loginErrorMessage=ERR_CAPTCHA_INCORRECT");
        sugar_cleanup(true);
    }
}
```

**Boom!** With the namespace set, Securimage now knows which CAPTCHA challenge it’s validating and—guess what?—it works!

### Why Does This Work?

The magic is in the **namespace**. By setting the same namespace during both CAPTCHA generation and validation, we’re making sure that Securimage keeps track of the right CAPTCHA data, no matter what SuiteCRM’s session does (or doesn’t do). This trick avoids that annoying first-time failure and saves us from having to refresh the CAPTCHA image.

## Conclusion

There you have it! The reason behind the first-load CAPTCHA failure in SuiteCRM is all about session management. The solution? Namespaces in Securimage. Set them during generation, use them during validation, and voilà—it works.

While I might have been forced to overlook a few things (like hardcoding the namespace), this fix gets the job done for now. And hey, at least I didn’t waste *your* entire afternoon!
